# Ex.No: 11  Design of Car Game using Heuristic Distance-Based  AI for Proximity 
### DATE: 25/10/2024                                                                           
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212221040145
### AIM: 
To write a Python program to simulate the car racing game using Pygame.
### Algorithm:
1.Initialize the Game:
  Import necessary libraries such as pygame and initialize the game environment.
  Set up the screen dimensions, player car, AI car, and background.
  
2.Define Car Movement Logic:
  Create movement controls for the playerâ€™s car using key press events (LEFT and RIGHT arrows).
  Implement AI movement logic with obstacle detection to dodge bombs.
  
3.Add Obstacles (Bombs):
  Randomly generate bombs at the top of the screen that fall downwards.
  Ensure they have random speeds and positions.
  
4.Collision Detection:
  Implement collision detection between cars (both player and AI) and the bombs.
  
5.Score Calculation:
  Update scores based on proximity to obstacles, with points awarded to both the player and AI for dodging.

6.Game Over Logic:
  When the player or AI collides with an obstacle, display a game-over screen with the option to retry or quit.
  
7.End the Game:
  If the player chooses to quit, close the game; otherwise, reset the game for another round.
